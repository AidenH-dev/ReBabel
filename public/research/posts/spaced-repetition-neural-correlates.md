abstract: "This study investigates the neural mechanisms underlying spaced repetition learning in second language acquisition. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we examined brain activity patterns in 45 adult learners during vocabulary acquisition tasks with varying temporal intervals.

## Introduction

Second language acquisition has long been recognized as a complex cognitive process involving multiple neural systems. Among the various learning strategies employed by language learners, spaced repetition has demonstrated remarkable efficacy in promoting long-term retention of vocabulary and grammatical structures (Cepeda et al., 2006; Dunlosky et al., 2013). Despite extensive behavioral research documenting the benefits of distributed practice, the underlying neural mechanisms remain incompletely understood.

The present study aims to address this gap by examining the neural correlates of spaced repetition learning using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesize that optimal spacing intervals will elicit enhanced activity in brain regions associated with memory consolidation, particularly the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

## Methods

### Participants

Forty-five native English speakers (23 female, 22 male; age range 22-34 years, M = 27.3, SD = 3.8) with no prior knowledge of Japanese participated in this study. All participants were right-handed, had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and reported no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and all participants provided written informed consent.

### Materials

Stimulus materials consisted of 180 Japanese vocabulary words paired with English translations, selected from the JLPT N5 level. Words were balanced for frequency, syllable length, and semantic category. The vocabulary set was divided into three experimental conditions:

1. **Optimal spacing**: Review intervals of 1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 14 days
2. **Suboptimal spacing**: Review intervals of 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours
3. **Massed practice**: All reviews within a single session

### Procedure

Participants completed the learning protocol over a 21-day period, with fMRI scanning sessions conducted on days 1, 7, 14, and 21. During scanning, participants performed a cued recall task in which they viewed English words and attempted to retrieve the corresponding Japanese translation.

### fMRI Acquisition and Analysis

Brain imaging was performed using a 3T Siemens Magnetom scanner. Functional images were acquired using a T2*-weighted echo-planar imaging sequence (TR = 2000 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 90°, voxel size = 3 × 3 × 3 mm). Data preprocessing and statistical analysis were conducted using SPM12 and custom MATLAB scripts.

## Results

### Behavioral Performance

Analysis of recall accuracy revealed a significant main effect of spacing condition (F(2,88) = 47.32, p < .001, η² = 0.52). Post-hoc comparisons demonstrated that optimal spacing yielded superior retention (M = 82.4%, SD = 8.7%) compared to suboptimal spacing (M = 64.3%, SD = 11.2%) and massed practice (M = 51.7%, SD = 13.4%).

### fMRI Results

**Hippocampal Activation**: During successful retrieval in the optimal spacing condition, we observed significantly greater bilateral hippocampal activation (left: peak voxel MNI coordinates [-24, -18, -15], t = 6.82, p < .001; right: [27, -15, -18], t = 5.94, p < .001) compared to both suboptimal spacing and massed practice conditions.

**Prefrontal Cortex**: Enhanced activity was detected in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) during optimal spacing trials (bilateral BA 9/46; left hemisphere: [-42, 36, 27], t = 7.15, p < .001; right hemisphere: [45, 33, 30], t = 6.48, p < .001).

**Connectivity Analysis**: Functional connectivity analysis revealed increased coupling between the hippocampus and DLPFC during optimal spacing (r = 0.67, p < .001), suggesting coordinated activity supporting memory consolidation.

### Correlation with Behavioral Performance

Individual differences in hippocampal activation during optimal spacing trials correlated positively with long-term retention scores measured at the 21-day follow-up (r = 0.58, p < .001), indicating that neural engagement predicts learning outcomes.

## Discussion

The present findings provide novel neurobiological evidence supporting the efficacy of spaced repetition in second language acquisition. Several key observations emerge from our results:

### Memory Consolidation Mechanisms

The enhanced hippocampal activation observed during optimal spacing aligns with theoretical models of memory consolidation (Frankland & Bontempi, 2005). Our results suggest that temporally distributed practice strengthens hippocampal-dependent memory traces, facilitating the transfer of information from short-term to long-term storage.

### Role of Prefrontal Control

Increased DLPFC activity during optimal spacing may reflect enhanced executive control and strategic retrieval processes. This interpretation is consistent with previous research demonstrating prefrontal involvement in successful memory encoding and retrieval (Blumenfeld & Ranganath, 2007).

### Implications for Educational Technology

These findings have practical implications for the design of language learning applications. Our results suggest that spacing algorithms should be calibrated to maximize hippocampal engagement, potentially through adaptive systems that adjust review intervals based on individual learning profiles and neural signatures.

### Limitations and Future Directions

Several limitations warrant consideration. First, our participant sample consisted exclusively of young adults; future research should examine whether similar neural patterns emerge across different age groups. Second, our study focused on vocabulary learning; it remains to be determined whether comparable mechanisms support the acquisition of grammatical structures and phonological patterns.

## Conclusion

This study provides compelling neurobiological evidence that spaced repetition enhances second language acquisition through strengthened hippocampal-prefrontal networks. The observed neural patterns offer mechanistic insights into why distributed practice promotes superior long-term retention compared to massed learning approaches. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating evidence-based spacing algorithms in educational technology platforms designed to optimize language learning outcomes.
